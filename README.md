# Language-Aware Images

A drop-in TMDB image provider for Jellyfin that gives you posters in your
library's language with a clean fallback to English — and skips the textless
no-language posters the built-in provider often picks instead.

## Install

In Jellyfin: *Admin → Plugins → Repositories → +* and add

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superuser404notfound/jellyfin-plugin-language-aware-images/main/manifest.json
```

Then *Catalog → Metadata → Language-Aware Images → Install*. Restart the server.

> After install, go to *Admin → Library → (your library) → Image Fetchers* and
> drag **Language-Aware TMDB Images** to the top — otherwise the built-in
> provider still wins.

## Configuration

*Admin → Plugins → Language-Aware Images*:

| Field                            | Default | Notes                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | :-----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PreferredLanguageOverride`      | empty   | Empty = use each library's metadata language. Set e.g. `de` to force globally. |
| `FallbackLanguage`               |  `en`   | Used when no image in the preferred language exists.                           |
| `IncludeOriginalLanguage`        | `false` | Add the title's original language as a third bucket (e.g. Japanese for anime). |
| `IncludeNoLanguageForPosters`    | `false` | Allow textless posters as last resort.                                         |
| `IncludeNoLanguageForBackdrops`  | `true`  | Backdrops are usually language-agnostic anyway.                                |
| `IncludeNoLanguageForLogos`      | `true`  | Most studio logos are designed without text.                                   |
| `MinimumVoteCount`               |   `0`   | Drops images with fewer votes. `0` = keep everything (recommended).            |
| `TmdbApiKey`                     | empty   | Bring your own TMDB key. Empty = uses Jellyfin's bundled key.                  |

The bucket order — preferred → original (opt-in) → fallback → textless (opt-in
per type) — and a `vote_count DESC, vote_average DESC` sort within each bucket
matches TMDB's own `/images` UI.

## Why

Jellyfin's built-in TMDB provider respects the library language for
language-matched posters, but when no match exists it prefers **textless**
(no-language-tag) posters over the English ones —
[jellyfin/jellyfin#9878](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/9878).
Textless posters on TMDB are often awkwardly chosen: cropped stills, alternate
art, foreign-market exports without text. The result is a library that looks
visually inconsistent.

This plugin enforces a clean cascade:

1. Posters in the library's language
2. English fallback (configurable)
3. Textless — only if you opt in (useful for logos, off by default)

Within each bucket, images are sorted by `vote_count DESC, vote_average DESC` —
the same order TMDB's `/images` UI uses, so you get the most popular poster
in the matching language rather than a random one.
